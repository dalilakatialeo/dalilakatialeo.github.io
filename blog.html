            <h1>100 days of code - Day 1</h1>
            <h2>Sunday, 8 August 2021 - 10:20pm</h2>
            <p>
                I have decided to join the "100 days of code" challenge - starting today!
            </p>
            <p>Google is always just a click away, but for those not in the know, this is a challenge aimed at encoraging people to develop new coding skills, by committing to code for at least one hour every day. <br>
                Instead of posting my progress on Twitter, which I don't have!, I will hold myself accountable by adding a blog post about my coding goals and achievements here.
            </p>
            <p>Today, I will be focusing on fine tuning my personal website, tidying up my github repos and starting a new web page project to add to my portfolio. I would like to create an interactive page this time, so I'll be looking at including some Javascript to it!

            <h1>Lockdown productivity</h1>
            <h2>Wednesday, 4 August 2021 - 1:03pm</h2>
            <p>
                A few days into lockdown and productivity is starting to kick in.
            </p>
            <p>I am ~this~ close to complete the weather project in Python (I am struggling a little bit with the final daily summary, as I don't think I am returning in the correct format).
            </p>
            <p>
                I have been dedicating quite a lot of time to this very website, and it has been a fun ride so far! I am perfecting my CSS skills and it is very satisfying to see my design come to life!

            <h1>Progress on Python weather project</h1>
            <h2>Saturday, 31 July 2021 - 10:12pm</h2>
            <p>
                Today, despite lockdown looming over Brisbane, the 2021 She Codes Plus cohort was able to meet in person at the Hub!
            </p>
            <p>
                Luckily, we were able to focus on our Python projects (the deadline is fast approaching!) and got assistance from our mentors.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was excited to finish most of my weather project functions and the all passed the test! I will be spending the next few days working on the summary functions and hopefully I will be comfortably finished by the end of the week.
