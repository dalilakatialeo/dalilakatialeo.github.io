            <h1>100 days of code - 3/100</h1>
            <h2>Sunday, 9 January 2022 - 11:30pm</h2>
            <p>And here we are on day 3!</p>
            <p>I spent most of my coding time today working on the JavaScript resources I found on W3C: the training materials are excellent and there is some kind of reassurance in learning from such an institution.<br/></p>
            <p>I briefly tidied up my portfolio and fixed a responsiveness bug I had in my Stack page, collected other resources on accessibility (a11y) and internationalisation (i18n) and I put together some light-reading material about Sass preprocessor.</p>
            <p>I am looking forward to mastering all the frontend technologies, I find them so interesting and I like that they really are the point of interaction between humans and computers &#128105 &#10084 &#129302.</p>

            <h1>100 days of code - 2/100</h1>
            <h2>Saturday, 8 January 2022 - 10:49am</h2>
            <p>
                I dedicated day 2/100 to frontend. <br/>
                I have long been an advocate for accessibility and I decided to gain some formal recognition of my efforts, so today I pursued and obtained a certification badge from <a class="blog-link" href="https://thegymnasium.com/courses/course-v1:GYM+016+0/about">Gynmasium</a>. </p>
            <p>
                The course was taught by Ethan Marcotte who, I was unaware, is the "creator" of responsive web design.<br/>
                It was very interesting to learn about the different techniques that can be used to make web browsing more accessible, from focus states to viewport aware design and I look forward to incorporating them in my works from now on!

            <p>
                And so it begins!
            </p>
            <p>
                I have finally decided to hold myself accountable and I am going to start the "100 Days of Code" challenge: <br/> I am going to be coding for at least one hour everyday for 100 days!

                As I am not a Twitter user, I will be posting my progress on my blog here.
            </p>
            <p>Today is day number one and here is what I have been up to:</p>
            <p>
                - I freed up some Heroku space by undeploying a super glitchy app and transferring it to localhost only<br/>
                - I have researched new cloud hosting services and decided to stick to Heroku for my new app's backend, but move to Netlify for its React frontend<br/>
                - I have deployed my new app's backend to Heroku<br/>
                - I have updated my portfolio's projects page and this blog<br/>
            </p>
            <p> I am very much looking forward to playing with some frontend tomorrow!</p>

            <h1>Post Grad activities</h1>
            <h2>Saturday, 18 December 2021 - 2:59pm</h2>
            <p>
                It has been a little while since I had the chance to update this blog! What's been happening?</p>
            <p>I completed my crowdfunding app! After the Django backend we spent some time learning React and I was able to create a nice little full stack application: find it <a class="blog-link" href="https://locally-crowdfund.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">here</a>!</p>
            <p>Our final group project with SheCodes saw 5 of us dealing with real client's expectations and deadlines, multiple git fires!, MVPs and collaboration. It certainly wasn't easy but what we managed to create and deliver can be found <em><a href="https://secret-island-31015.herokuapp.com/">here.</a></em></p>
            <p>On Tuesday 7th December, SheCodes Australia organised an amazing Showcase for our graduation: it was incredible to see how far we've all come since day 1 and a little bit bittersweet to know that, although I am keen to gain some free time back!, this chapter of my life is over. Onwards and upwards!</p>
            <p>I have spent the past couple of weeks working on my very own full stack app! Whilst the concept of it is fairly simple, it will hopefully help me solve organisation issues within my very own household, so I am definitely keen to see it come to life!</p>

            <h1>Crowdfunding app and REST API</h1>
            <h2>Friday, 1 October 2021 - 4:58pm</h2>
            <p>
                In the past few weeks, my SheCodes journey took me to Django-land and I must admit it took me a little while to wrap my head around it all.<br/>
                At first, it all seemed so complicated and I couldn't quite understand how it would all come together. <br/>
                The more I delved into it, though, the more I understood how the framework works and why it is so convenient to use: regardless of the project, most of the structure has already been put together!
            </p>
            <p>Recently, we have been focussing on the creation of the backend of our <em>Grand Project</em>: a Crowdfunding app!</p>
            <p>The backend was created with the Django REST framework, which allowed us to put together the working structure of the application.</p>
            <p>We are now tackling the front end, which is developed with JavaScript and the React framework - it is so exciting to be jumping back to the front end as I feel like it comes a bit more natually to me. <br/>
                I am looking forward to seeing my progress in the next few weeks!

            <h1>Making friends with Django</h1>
            <h2>Saturday, 21 August 2021 - 10:28am</h2>
            <p>
                We have been tackling a different challenge at She Codes these past couple of weeks: Django!
            </p>
            <p>I would lie if I said it didn't feel overwhelming at first! As a Python-based web framework, Django is supposed to tie Python and front-end together and making things easier, development-side.<br/>
            The learning curve felt extra steep though, as there were so many loose bits and I couldn't quite wrap my head around the what's and the why's. <br/>
            As one of my mentors put it, it felt like "Drinking from a firehose" haha!</p>
            <p>A little extra dedication went a long way though! I spent some time reviewing the course material as well as started a separate "blog" project in Django to solidify my learning and it's paying off!
            I will hopefully be able to have a couple of fully functioning Django projects to my portfolio soon, which is exciting!

            <h1>Lockdown productivity</h1>

            <p>
                A few days into lockdown and productivity is starting to kick in.
            </p>
            <p>I am ~this~ close to complete the weather project in Python (I am struggling a little bit with the final daily summary, as I don't think I am returning in the correct format).
            </p>
            <p>
                I have been dedicating quite a lot of time to this very website, and it has been a fun ride so far! I am perfecting my CSS skills and it is very satisfying to see my design come to life!

            <h1>Progress on Python weather project</h1>
            <h2>Saturday, 31 July 2021 - 10:12pm</h2>
            <p>
                Today, despite lockdown looming over Brisbane, the 2021 She Codes Plus cohort was able to meet in person at the Hub!
            </p>
            <p>
                Luckily, we were able to focus on our Python projects (the deadline is fast approaching!) and got assistance from our mentors.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was excited to finish most of my weather project functions and the all passed the test! I will be spending the next few days working on the summary functions and hopefully I will be comfortably finished by the end of the week.
